> Try, for a moment to imagine what “[Typescript with React](https://egghead.io/courses/use-typescript-to-develop-react-applications)" visually looks like. Or "[A Server-rendered ReactJS Application with Next.js](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-server-rendered-reactjs-application-with-next-js)". Or the "[State Monad in JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript)"

> Not exactly a vivid picture in your mind, right?

> This is partly because programming is an abstract activity. It has to be.  
> Taken literally, programming involves running enormously complex sequences of electrical currents. On a microscopic scale. Inside our machines.  
> That world isn't human friendly. We can't see what's going on or control what happens without a thick layer of symbolic software in the middle.
> 
> So we invented programming languages.  
> The JavaScript snippet `let fruit = banana` _maps onto_ a specific set of electrical pulses firing deep inside your hardware.
> 
> In programmer land this is called an _abstraction_.
> 
> Funnily enough, it also fits our definition of a metaphor. _Programming is just a giant stack of metaphors._ Each layer of the metaphorical stack moves us further away from machine world, and closer to human world.
