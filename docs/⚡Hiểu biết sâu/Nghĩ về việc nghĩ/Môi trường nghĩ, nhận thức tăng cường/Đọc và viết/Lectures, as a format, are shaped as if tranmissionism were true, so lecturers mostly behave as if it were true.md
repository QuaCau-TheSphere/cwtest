>Lectures, as a medium, have no carefully-considered cognitive model at their foundation. Yet if we were aliens observing typical lectures from afar, we might notice the _implicit_ model they appear to share: “the lecturer says words describing an idea; the class hears the words and maybe scribbles in a notebook; then the class understands the idea.” In learning sciences, we call this model “[transmissionism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/transmissionism).” It’s the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcribing text from one page onto another. If only! The idea is so thoroughly discredited that “transmissionism” is only used pejoratively, in reference to naive historical teaching practices. Or as an ad-hominem in juicy academic spats.

>Of course, good lecturers don’t usually _believe_ that simply telling their audience about an idea causes them to understand it. It’s just that lectures, as a format, are shaped _as if_ that were true, so lecturers mostly _behave_ as if it were true.
