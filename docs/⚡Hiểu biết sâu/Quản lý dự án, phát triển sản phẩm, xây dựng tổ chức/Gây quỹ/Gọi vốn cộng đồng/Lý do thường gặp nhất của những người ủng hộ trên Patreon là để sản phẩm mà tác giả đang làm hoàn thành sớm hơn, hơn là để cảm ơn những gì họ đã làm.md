>In December of 2020, I asked my patrons to briefly explain why they support my work. Roughly a quarter of my patrons wrote back. The vast majority framed their motivations in terms of supporting production of future work. Some people quite specifically want to use a prototype I’m developing; others just want to see certain ideas developed further. About a third framed their funding in terms of “[people, not projects](https://www.nature.com/articles/477529a),” expressing general confidence that I’ll do interesting work. Naturally, that’s my favorite kind of support. After this cluster of answers, the distant second most common motivation was access to the behind-the-scenes content.

khi được hỏi trực tiếp, thì rất ít người nói rằng họ làm vậy để được đọc cái bài viết chỉ dành cho người ủng hộ
